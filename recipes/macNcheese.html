    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mac and cheese is a perfect dish to riff on. You can swap pasta shapes,
      use your favorite cheeses, and the topping possibilities are pretty
      endless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the pasta cooks right in the sauce base, you need to be methodical
      in swapping shapes. Rather than choosing a shape similar in size to
      macaroni, choose a shape that has a cook time that fits in a 6 to 9-minute
      window, like large elbows or mini farfalle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe uses a combination of three cheeses. I love this combo because
      cheddar provides a lot of flavor, Monterey Jack is an amazing melting
      cheese that makes the sauce smooth, and cream cheese makes the sauce extra
      creamy and silky. When swapping cheeses in this recipe, don’t replace the
      cream cheese, but you can play around with the other two. Ensure the
      cheese(s) you choose are nice and melty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t have Ritz crackers on hand for the topping? No worries! You can swap
      them for another flaky cracker like Club or Town House, or even saltines
      or oyster crackers. Consider Cheez-Its or Goldfish crackers for an extra
      cheesy punch.

            <h3>Prepare the topping (optional):</h3>
            <p>
                Melt the butter in a 10-inch Dutch oven or other heavy, deep pot over medium heat. Add the crushed crackers, black pepper, and kosher salt and stir to coat with the melted butter. Continue to toast over medium heat, stirring often, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Transfer the toasted cracker crumbs to a plate to cool and wipe the pot clean of any tiny crumbs.
            </p>

            <h3>Begin preparing the mac and cheese: </h3>
            <p>
                In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the ground mustard, pepper, and cayenne (if using). Stir to combine with the butter and lightly toast until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds. Take care to not let the spices or butter begin to brown. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Add the water, half and half, and kosher salt to the butter mixture and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, uncovered.
            </p>

        <li>
            <h3>Cook the pasta: </h3>

            <p>
                Once boiling, stir in the elbow macaroni, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a rolling boil (but not boil over). Continue to cook uncovered, stirring every minute or so, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is reduced enough to reveal the top layer of elbows, 6 to 9 minutes. The liquid mixture should just be visible around the edges of the pot, but still with enough to pool when you drag a spatula through the pasta. Remove from the heat.

            <h3>Add the cheeses: </h3>
            <p>

            <p>
                Taste the mac and cheese. Season with more salt and pepper as needed. Serve immediately topped with the toasted Ritz topping, if using. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Leftover mac and cheese can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
